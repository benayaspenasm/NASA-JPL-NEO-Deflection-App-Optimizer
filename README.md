# NASA-JPL-NEO-Deflection-App-Optimizer

* Web scraping and optimization of the minimum delta-v to deviate an asteroid to the required distance from Earth

* wrapper.py where the hyperparameters are set (number of cores, deflection time, delta-v direction, and required distance from Earth) 
  and instantiates get_NDA_DV_mode_info.py in parallel
